                                    players who havenâ€™t finished their quota. For example, In a
                                    IND vs ENG T20 match England has completed playing 20 over
                                    and India got to play 10 over post that the match got
                                    stopped due to rain, Then Indian players will get points
                                    based on the above mentioned rule. (Note: This is not
                                    applicable to the player who has already got out before the
                                    match got stopped)

                                        To begin the session, each player picks a card at random
                                        from the shuffled deck. Seating is as per card value:
                                        whoever draws the highest card chooses his seat, to his
                                        right the next highest and so on. The lowest, thus, sits to
                                        the left of the highest. The lowest deals first and shuffles
                                        the cards.
                                    </li>

                                        The player to the left of the dealer draws a card unseen
                                        from the shuffled deck and places it on the table face up,
                                        visible to all. This card is known as the 'joker': all cards
                                        of the same rank as this turned up card as well as the
                                        printed jokers are used as wild cards, and all these cards
                                        are referred to as 'jokers'. If the card turned up is a
                                        printed joker then will also count ACE as a joker.
                                    </li>

                                        The player to the dealer's left then cuts the remaining
                                        cards and the dealer distributes them anti-clockwise one at
                                        a time, the player to the dealer's right getting the first
                                        card. 13 cards are dealt to each player. One card is dealt
                                        face up to begin the discard pile and the remaining stack is
                                        placed face down in the centre crosswise on top of the
                                        turned up joker, so that the rank of the joker remains
                                        visible.

                                        For the next hand the turn to deal passes to the right, and
                                        this continues until everyone has dealt once, completing a
                                        "round". After playing one or two rounds, the seating is
                                        changed again following the same start procedure. Normally a
                                        player should quit the play only at the end of a round.

                                        The player to the dealer's right plays first, and play
                                        continues counter-clockwise. Each player's turn consists of
                                        picking up either the top card of the face up discard pile
                                        or the top card of the face down stack. Having taken this
                                        card into hand the player must discard one card from hand
                                        face up on top of the discard pile.

                                        If the player chooses to take the top card of the discard
                                        pile, that card cannot be discarded in the same turn - the
                                        player must discard a different card.

                                        It sometimes happens that the card turned up by the dealer
                                        to start the discard pile is a joker, which can then be
                                        picked up by the first player in the normal way. Since this
                                        clearly gives the first player an advantage, it may
                                        encourage several other players to drop (see below).
                                    </li>

                                        The play continues until a player, after picking up a card,
                                        has 13 cards that form valid combinations (including at
                                        least one pure sequence and at least one other sequence as
                                        explained below). In this case the player discards the 14th

                                        winning the game.
